# co2
Arduino ESP8266 NodeMCU V2 with MH-Z19B &amp; WS2812B Digitale 5050 RGB LED Strip - 60 LEDs 1m

Code based on https://github.com/AntwerpDesignFactory/tjilp

But instead of a piezo buzzer i use a LED strip to indicate the level of Co2 in the room.

Also the measured CO2 level is tracked in a InfluxDB database every 15 seconds.
